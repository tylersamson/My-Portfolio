        <h3>Path to Thinkful</h3>
        <p>I was intriuged by coding and web development for multiple reasons and I think web development is an integral part of the world we live in. I think it's so cool that I'm going to make my own websites and know how to do everything by scratch. I also value the importance of collaboration and I understand that making great things, requires amazing teams working together. </p>
        <p>Outside of thinkful and my day job I have many interests and hobbies. Right now I'm really into hooping with my friends, skating, going to the beach, and just being outside in general. I love hammocking, listening to music and working out.</p>
